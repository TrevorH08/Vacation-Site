        <p class="text-danger">"Toyko is by far the cleanest city to which I have ever travelled.
          It is aso the largest and busiest city to which I have ever travelled.
          The amount of effort the people of Tokyo go to in order to ensure both sanity and sanitation is simply astounding.
          Sights one must visit while in Tokyo include Harajuku (shopping/fashion), Ueno (Ameyoko for cheap shopping / Ueno Park/zoo),
          Shibuya (area for young adults), and Shinjuku (nightlife / red light district)."

          And it is, Kyoto is a gem, but Tokyo is AMAZING!
          Tokyo's energy, life and size make New York City
          seem slow and small in comparison."</p>
